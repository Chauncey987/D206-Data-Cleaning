# D206-Data-Cleaning
This task focuses on addressing an organizational question or decision using a selected dataset. The process begins with defining a realistic and relevant research question and thoroughly describing all variables in the dataset, including their data types and examples to clarify their roles.

The next step involves developing a detailed data-cleaning plan to ensure the dataset's quality. This includes proposing techniques and steps to identify data issues, justifying the selected approach based on the dataset's characteristics, and providing annotated code to implement the plan. The cleaning process also involves addressing data anomalies and summarizing the outcomes of each cleaning step, along with providing a cleaned dataset in CSV format. Limitations of the cleaning process are highlighted, along with their potential impact on analyzing the research question.

Finally, the task incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify significant features in the dataset. This involves determining the total number of principal components, justifying the reduced number of components using a scree plot, and discussing the benefits of PCA for the organization. Annotated code and visual outputs are included throughout the process to ensure clarity and reproducibility of the analysis.
